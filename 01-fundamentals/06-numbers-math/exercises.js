/**
 * JavaScript Numbers and Math - Exercises
 * ====================================
 * Complete the following exercises to practice working with JavaScript numbers and math.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 1: Number Creation and Basic Operations
 *
 * 1. Create three variables:
 *    - An integer
 *    - A floating point number
 *    - A number using scientific notation
 * 2. Perform and log the results of:
 *    - Addition of all three numbers
 *    - Multiplication of all three numbers
 *    - Division of the floating point by the integer
 *    - Remainder when the scientific notation number is divided by the integer

/**
 * Exercise 2: Number Methods and Properties
 *
 * 1. Create a variable 'price' with the value 42.9687
 * 2. Format the price to display exactly 2 decimal places (e.g., 42.97)
 * 3. Convert the price to a string that shows exactly 3 significant digits
 * 4. Check if the original price is an integer using a built-in method
 * 5. Find the largest and smallest integer that JavaScript can safely represent and log them

/**
 * Exercise 3: Math Object
 *
 * 1. Calculate and log:
 *    - The square root of 16
 *    - 2 raised to the power of 8
 *    - The absolute value of -45.3
 *    - The larger of 12 and 19
 *    - A random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
 * 2. Round the following numbers and log the results:
 *    - 4.6 (round to nearest integer)
 *    - 4.6 (round down)
 *    - 4.6 (round up)

/**
 * Exercise 4: Number Conversions
 *
 * 1. Convert the following strings to numbers using different methods:
 *    - "42" (using Number())
 *    - "3.14159" (using parseFloat())
 *    - "1010" as binary (using parseInt with radix)
 *    - "FF" as hexadecimal (using parseInt with radix)
 * 2. Convert the number 255 to:
 *    - A binary string
 *    - A hexadecimal string
 *    - An octal string

/**
 * Exercise 5: Handling Special Number Cases
 *
 * 1. Create examples that result in:
 *    - NaN
 *    - Infinity
 *    - -Infinity
 * 2. Use the appropriate methods to check:
 *    - If a value is NaN
 *    - If a value is finite
 *    - If a value is a safe integer
 * 3. Log the results

/**
 * Exercise 6: Floating-Point Precision
 *
 * 1. Log the result of 0.1 + 0.2
 * 2. Check if 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.3 directly
 * 3. Implement a function called 'areAlmostEqual' that:
 *    - Takes two numbers and an optional epsilon (default 0.0001)
 *    - Returns true if the absolute difference is less than epsilon
 * 4. Use your function to check if 0.1 + 0.2 is approximately equal to 0.3

/**
 * Exercise 7: Calculating with Percentages
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'calculateDiscount' that:
 *    - Takes an original price and a discount percentage
 *    - Returns the final price after the discount
 *    - Formats the result to 2 decimal places
 * 2. Test your function with:
 *    - Original price: 80, Discount: 25% (should return 60.00)
 *    - Original price: 30, Discount: 10% (should return 27.00)
 */

/**
 * Exercise 8: Basic Statistical Calculations
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'calculateStats' that:
 *    - Takes an array of numbers
 *    - Returns an object with: sum, average, minimum, maximum, and range
 * 2. Test your function with the array: [18, 27, 5, 42, 13, 30]
 * 3. Log the results

/**
 * Exercise 9: Practical Application - Loan Calculator
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'calculateLoan' that:
 *    - Takes parameters for principal (amount borrowed), annualRate (as a percentage),
 *      and loanTerm (in years)
 *    - Calculates the monthly payment using the formula:
 *      P * r * (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1) where:
 *      P = principal
 *      r = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 and then by 100)
 *      n = total number of payments (years * 12)
 *    - Returns an object with: monthlyPayment, totalPayment, and totalInterest
 *    - Formats all results to 2 decimal places
 *
 * 2. Test with a $200,000 loan, 4.5% annual interest, 30 year term

/**
 * Exercise 10: Challenge - Fibonacci Sequence
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'fibonacci' that:
 *    - Takes a number 'n' as an argument
 *    - Returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence
 *    - The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
 *      (each number is the sum of the two previous ones)
 * 2. Calculate and log the 10th and 20th numbers in the sequence
 * 3. BONUS: Implement the function both recursively and iteratively
 *    and compare their performance for large values of n
