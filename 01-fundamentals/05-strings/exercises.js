/**
 * JavaScript Strings - Exercises
 * ============================
 * Complete the following exercises to practice working with JavaScript strings.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 1: String Creation and Properties

/**
 * Exercise 3: String Methods - Basic Manipulation
 *
 * 1. Create a string variable containing "   Learn JavaScript   "
 * 2. Use string methods to:
 *    - Remove whitespace from both ends

 *
 * 1. Create variables for:
 *    - product (string)
 *    - price (number)
 *    - quantity (number)

/**
 * Exercise 8: Practical Application - Email Validation
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'isValidEmail' that:

/**
 * Exercise 9: String Case Manipulation
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'toCamelCase' that:
 *    - Takes a hyphenated or underscore-separated string as input
 *    - Converts it to camelCase (e.g., "hello-world" â†’ "helloWorld")
 * 2. Test your function with different inputs

/**
 * Exercise 10: Challenge - Password Strength Checker
 *
 * 1. Create a function called 'checkPasswordStrength' that:
 *    - Takes a password string as input
 *    - Returns an object with:
 *      a. strength: "weak", "medium", or "strong"
 *      b. messages: array of feedback messages
