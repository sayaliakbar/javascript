/**
 * JavaScript Operators - Exercises
 * ==============================
 * Complete the following exercises to practice working with JavaScript operators.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operations
 *
 * 1. Create two variables with numeric values
 * 2. Perform and store the following operations:
 *    - Addition
 *    - Subtraction
 *    - Multiplication
 *    - Division
 *    - Remainder (modulus)
 *    - Exponentiation
 * 3. Log all the results with descriptive messages
 * 4. Create a variable and demonstrate both postfix and prefix increment

/**
 * Exercise 2: Assignment Operations
 *
 * 1. Create a variable 'score' with initial value 100
 * 2. Use assignment operators to perform the following:
 *    - Add 50 to the score
 *    - Subtract 30 from the result
 *    - Multiply the result by 2
 *    - Divide the result by 4
 *    - Set score to the remainder when divided by 5
 * 3. Log the final value

/**
 * Exercise 3: Comparison Operations
 *
 * 1. Create variables for your age and someone else's age
 * 2. Use comparison operators to check and log:
 *    - If your age is greater than the other age
 *    - If your age is less than or equal to the other age
 *    - If your age is strictly equal to the numeric string of your age
 *    - If your age is loosely equal to the numeric string of your age

/**
 * Exercise 4: Logical Operations
 *
 * 1. Create boolean variables: isRaining, hasUmbrella, isCold, hasJacket
 * 2. Use logical operators to check and log:
 *    - If someone should take umbrella (isRaining AND NOT hasUmbrella)
 *    - If someone should go outside (NOT isRaining OR hasUmbrella)
 *    - If someone should take jacket (isCold AND NOT hasJacket)
 *    - If someone is fully prepared for bad weather (hasUmbrella AND hasJacket)

/**
 * Exercise 5: String Concatenation
 *
 * 1. Create variables for first name, last name, city, and age
 * 2. Use the + operator to create a sentence about this person
 * 3. Use the += operator to add more information to your sentence
 * 4. Log the final sentence
 */

/**
 * Exercise 6: The Ternary Operator
 *
 * 1. Create a variable 'hour' with the current hour (0-23)
 * 2. Use the ternary operator to create a greeting:
 *    - If hour < 12: "Good morning!"
 *    - If hour is between 12-17: "Good afternoon!"
 *    - If hour is 18 or more: "Good evening!"
 *    (Hint: You can nest ternary operators)
 * 3. Log the greeting

/**
 * Exercise 7: Operator Precedence
 *
 * 1. Without calculating, write what you think the answers will be:
 *    - 4 + 5 * 2
 *    - (4 + 5) * 2
 *    - 10 / 2 + 3
 *    - 10 / (2 + 3)
 * 2. Log the actual calculations to check your answers
 * 3. Explain any differences you find

/**
 * Exercise 8: Short-Circuit Evaluation
 *
 * 1. Create a variable 'username' that is null or an empty string
 * 2. Use the || (OR) operator to assign a default value to 'displayName'
 * 3. Log the displayName
 * 4. Create an object 'user' that is null
 * 5. Use the && (AND) operator to safely access a property of user
 * 6. Log the result

/**
 * Exercise 9: Challenge - Shopping Cart with Operators
 *
 * Create a basic shopping cart calculation:
 * 1. Create variables for:
 *    - Cart subtotal (100)
 *    - Tax rate (8%)
 *    - Shipping (flat rate of 10)
 *    - Discount code (boolean true/false)
 *    - Discount amount (15)
 *
 * 2. Calculate and log:
 *    - Tax amount
 *    - Whether shipping should be free (subtotal > 75)
 *    - Applied discount (if discount code is true)
 *    - Final total (subtotal + tax + shipping - discount)
 *
 * 3. Use at least one example of each:
 *    - Arithmetic operators
 *    - Assignment operators
 *    - Comparison operators
 *    - Logical operators
 *    - Ternary operator
